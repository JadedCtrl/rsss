RSSS : `RSSS SAGE`	An RSS parser~
================================================================================

rsss is made to make your life (hopefully) a bit easier when you've got to deal
with RSS data.

It has functions for easily parsing both the overarching stucture, and the
individual <item>'s.


----------------------------------------
USAGE
----------------------------------------

You're probably interested in `rsss:feed-items`, which returns a list of every
item in the RSS feed, and the `rsss:title *data*`, `rsss:description`, etc.,
which fetch the traits of individual <item>'s or the overarching <channel>.

They're called like so: (function *data*), where *data* is the XML data.
